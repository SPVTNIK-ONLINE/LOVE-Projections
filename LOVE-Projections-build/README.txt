LOVE-Projections renders 3D models (.obj files) by projecting them onto 2D space using a strong perspective projection approach. A primitive shader has been added, but z-buffering proved beyond my skill set, entirely ruining the effect.
 
To run the program, execute LOVE-Projections.exe.

The Program:
	Return		Next model
	Backspace	Previous model
	Space		Toggle shader
	q		Exit program
